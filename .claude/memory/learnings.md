## LRN-001 — `rtk` shape-compression silently breaks downstream parsers

- **Date**: 2026-04-22
- **Pattern**: when a tracking tool (`rtk`) intercepts stdout and returns a schematized/compressed representation instead of the raw payload, every downstream parser breaks silently — because the user (or the LLM) never sees `rtk`'s output, only the parser error.
- **Context**: `rtk curl` replaces raw JSON output with a tokenized version, regardless of TTY vs pipe. Claude Code hooks auto-rewrite `curl` → `rtk curl`, so the behavior is impossible to anticipate without knowing the hook.
- **Future application**: for any tool that auto-rewrites standard commands, explicitly verify pipe behavior. Documented workaround: `exclude_commands=["curl"]` in `~/.config/rtk/config.toml`, or `rtk proxy`. See `BLK-001`.

## LRN-002 — Moving report-file paths requires grepping bash READS, not just WRITES

- **Date**: 2026-04-23
- **Pattern**: when moving the write path of a generated file (report, artifact, cache), you must also grep the places that READ that file — not only those that write it. Dispatchers (orchestrator skills that dispatch to an agent and then parse the result) typically contain bash commands like `test -s X.md`, `grep ... X.md`, `wc -l X.md` — these refs are invisible if you only grep for "write" or "output path".
- **Context**: `.claude/audits/` refactor (commit `5c5e82c`). First pass: I updated write paths across 5 skills (seo/geo/harden/validate/code-clean) and 3 agents. The user asked for a verify-gate. They re-grepped and found 10+ bare bash refs (e.g. `test -s HARDEN.md`, `grep -oE ... VALIDATE.md`) I had missed — the dispatchers were broken (looking at project root while the agent was writing to `.claude/audits/`). Fixed in commit `5c5e82c` (bundled with the same commit).
- **Future application**:
  - Before declaring a file-path migration "complete", grep the **basename** (`grep -rn "HARDEN\.md"`) in addition to the full path — to catch bare bash usages.
  - If the file is used in pipelines (`test`, `grep`, `wc`, `cat`, `head`), search for those verbs explicitly.
  - **Verify-gates save work**: one extra round asked by the user forced exhaustive re-grepping. Without it, two dispatchers would have shipped broken.

## LRN-003 — Claude Code `disable*` settings use the sentinel string `"disable"`, not a boolean

- **Date**: 2026-04-27
- **Pattern**: Claude Code blocker-style settings (`disableAutoMode`, `disableBypassPermissionsMode`) use the literal string `"disable"` as a sentinel. The key being absent means the feature is available; the value `"disable"` is what turns the blocker on. Any other value (including `false`, `true`, `null`) has no effect — the doc explicitly states this.
- **Context**: switching `permissions.defaultMode` to `"auto"` while `disableAutoMode: "disable"` was still present would have failed at startup ("auto mode unavailable"). The naming `disable<Foo>: "disable"` reads ambiguously — easy to assume it's a boolean toggle and leave the key in place.
- **Future application**:
  - Before changing `defaultMode`, audit the matching `disable*` key in the same `permissions` block. If present with value `"disable"`, remove it.
  - Same logic for `bypassPermissions` mode and `disableBypassPermissionsMode`.
  - Don't trust the doc's naming — read the value semantics. Sentinel strings beat booleans here because the harness can distinguish "unset" from "explicitly off" (admin policy).
- **Reference**: commit `1421578`, doc `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings`.

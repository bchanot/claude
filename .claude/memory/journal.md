# Journal

## 2026-04-23

- Restructured tree: `tasks/` → `.claude/tasks/`, created `.claude/memory/` (5 registries) + `.claude/audits/`.
- Adapted CLAUDE.md + skills `onboard`, `init-project` + agent `onboarder` + `lib/project-archetypes/dotfiles-meta.md`.
- Added CAPITALIZE step in `ship-feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `feat`, `commit-change` + created `/close` skill for the session-end ritual.
- 2nd user verify-gate caught bugs: `.gitignore` was breaking tracking (fixed in BDR-003); harden/validate dispatcher bash was broken after the audit move (LRN-002).
- Audits routed to `.claude/audits/` (seo/geo/harden/validate/code-clean) + `MIGRATION.md` written for existing projects.
- 9 atomic commits (`c721a36..a9606aa`) via `/commit-change` — first real execution of Phase 4 CAPITALIZE.
- Decisions logged: BDR-002, BDR-003. Learnings: LRN-002. Blockers: BLK-002.
- English-only rule enforced in all CAPITALIZE specs (commit `bfcca72`); 9 existing entries retrofitted to English in follow-up commit.

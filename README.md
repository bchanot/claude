```

**Architecture principle:**
- `skills/` = entry points you invoke via `/skill-name`
- `agents/` = execution units called by skills (never invoked directly by user)
- `templates/` = symlinked to `~/.claude/templates/` — copy into projects via `/onboard` or manually
- **Graphify** builds a knowledge graph of any codebase (`/graphify query`), producing a navigable wiki in `graphify-out/wiki/`. This map helps Claude understand project structure, find relevant code faster, and reason across files. Essential for large-scope tasks (multi-file features, complex bugs, architectural changes). Small tasks should skip it and read files directly.

### Agent model routing (BDR-066)

Reflection (brainstorm, plan, contract, audit judgment, loop decisions) runs
INLINE on the session model — assumed Fable/Opus, enforced by a blocking
gate (`lib/model-gate.md` + `lib/model-check.sh`) at the entry of the 12
reflection orchestrators. Execution runs on pinned subagents:

| Agent | Model | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| feater, hotfixer | sonnet (pinned) | executors — code from a closed plan, fix-bundle appliers |
| verifier, security-auditor | sonnet (pinned) | fresh gates (≤3×/loop) |
| doc-syncer, onboarder, scaffolder, refactorer, interviewer, plugin-advisor | sonnet (pinned) | workers |
| status-reporter | haiku (pinned) | mechanical collector |
| client-handover-writer | opus (pinned, currently inert — inline-loaded; sonnet conversion planned) | deliverable writer |
| analyzer, seo-analyzer, geo-analyzer, validator-analyzer, code-cleaner, bugfixer, commit-changer | inherit session (Fable/Opus) | reflection / audit / inline playbooks |

## Fresh install (new machine)

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:youruser/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# 2. Bootstrap (CLI + auth + symlinks + plugins)
bash install.sh

# 3. Verify setup
bash doctor.sh

# 4. Restart Claude Code — plugins load automatically
```

All scripts use their own location to find the repo — run them from anywhere.
The plugins step logs to `install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`.

**Optional — Context7** (fast doc lookup for React / Next.js / Prisma…): the plugins
step installs the `ctx7` CLI and wires it into Claude Code itself — single surface =
the `find-docs` skill; the generated `rules/context7.md` is purged by design
(BDR-053). If you run `ctx7 setup` manually, delete that rule or re-run `make plugin`.

```bash
ctx7 login                 # optional: OAuth / API key for higher rate limits
```

## Installed components

| Component | Type | Description | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Superpowers** | Plugin (required) | Brainstorming, planning, subagent-driven dev, code review, branch finishing. Required by `/init-project` and `/ship-feature`. | [obra/superpowers-marketplace](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace) |
| **GStack** | Plugin (toggle) | Full-product workflow: UI + design + deploy + browser QA. Skip for backend/CLI projects. | [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) |
| **GSD v2** | External CLI | Multi-session orchestration: crash recovery, cost tracking, parallel workers, context-fresh execution. | [gsd-build/gsd-2](https://github.com/gsd-build/gsd-2) |
| **RTK** | Plugin (always on) | Code rewrite hook. Zero passive cost. | [rtk-ai/rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) |
| **security-guidance** | Plugin (always on) | Security hook. Zero passive cost. | [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| **ui-ux-pro-max** | Plugin (toggle) | Design system, color/typography choices. Enable for design-heavy projects. | [nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) |
| **Context7** | Plugin (toggle) | Fast-evolving libs doc lookup (Next.js, React, Prisma...). Works anonymously; optional `ctx7 login` raises rate limits. | [context7.com](https://context7.com/) |
| **pr-review-toolkit** | Plugin (toggle) | Multi-agent PR review. | [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| **Graphify** | Python CLI | Codebase → knowledge graph → navigable wiki. Helps Claude map and search projects efficiently. | [pypi: graphifyy](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/) |

Versions are pinned in `plugins.lock.json`. To update: edit the file, then re-run `install-plugins.sh`.

Graphify installs via **pipx/PyPI only, never npm/npx**: a different publisher
squats the same `graphifyy` name on npm (version-shadowing shim re-exporting
a different package, ships its own conflicting `graphify` bin) — see
`plugins.lock.json`'s `graphifyy` note.

## Three core workflows

### From scratch — `/init-project`

```
/plugin-check "description"     # configure plugins (also runs as STEP 0)
/init-project "description"     # interview → scaffold → implement → review
/ship-feature "next feature"    # ship feature by feature
```

### Existing project — `/onboard`

```
cd my-existing-project/
/onboard                        # generates CLAUDE.md + settings + .claudeignore
/plugin-check "project type"
/ship-feature "next feature"
```

### New feature — `/ship-feature`

```
/ship-feature "feature description"
# → STEP 0: plugin check
# → STEP 1-2: brainstorm + plan (superpowers)
# → STEP 3: validation gate — user approval required
# → STEP 4-7: implement (TDD) → review → capitalize (memory)
# → STEP 8: sync README (doc-sync)
# → STEP 9: finish (merge / PR)
```

For small features (1-5 files), use `/feat` instead — no orchestration overhead.

## Settings and permissions

Settings follow a hierarchy (highest priority first):

```
managed-settings.json   → enterprise (cannot be overridden)
CLI flags               → session only
.claude/settings.local  → personal machine overrides (gitignored)
.claude/settings.json   → project rules (committed)
~/.claude/settings.json → global user rules (this repo)
```

DENY always wins over ALLOW at any level. `.claudeignore` applies independently.

Templates for per-project settings are in `templates/settings/`. Copy them with `/onboard` or manually:
```bash
CONF="$(dirname "$(readlink ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)")"
cp "$CONF/templates/settings/settings.json" .claude/settings.json
cp "$CONF/templates/settings/.claudeignore" .claudeignore
```

See [`templates/settings/SETTINGS.md`](templates/settings/SETTINGS.md) for the full rule syntax reference (rule types, patterns, `defaultMode` values).

## Adding an MCP server that needs a secret

`claude mcp add <name> --env KEY=VALUE ...` writes `VALUE` **literally** into
`~/.claude.json` (or the project's `.mcp.json`) — if you pass the real secret
on that command line, it materializes as a second plaintext copy outside
`~/.claude/.env`, invisible to the repo's `.gitignore`/allowlist reach (this
bit us once: job7/BDR-026).

Claude Code expands `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` in `mcpServers` config —
in `env`, `command`, `args`, `url`, and `headers` — for both project (`.mcp.json`)
and user (`~/.claude.json`) scope. Use that instead of a literal value:

```bash
# WRONG — plaintext key lands in ~/.claude.json:
claude mcp add magic --scope user --env API_KEY="$MAGIC_API_KEY" -- npx -y @21st-dev/magic@latest

# RIGHT — single-quoted so bash doesn't expand it; Claude Code expands it at
# launch, reading the var from its own process environment:
claude mcp add magic --scope user --env 'API_KEY=${MAGIC_API_KEY}' -- npx -y @21st-dev/magic@latest
```

The var still has to exist in the **environment of the process that starts
`claude`** — sourcing `~/.claude/.env` into your everyday interactive shell
would defeat the point (every subprocess, every stray `env`/`printenv`, would
then see it). This repo's `~/.bashrc` instead wraps the `claude` command
itself: a `claude()` shell function sources `~/.claude/.env` into a subshell
and `exec`s the real binary, so the var reaches `claude` and its children only
— never the ambient shell. See `lib/toggle-external.sh`'s `magic` case for
the pattern to copy for a new MCP server.

There is no `claude mcp add` flag that writes the reference form for you —
the `${VAR}` syntax has to be typed by hand (or via a wrapper script), same as
above.

### magic MCP (`@21st-dev/magic`) — known callback-injection risk

`21st_magic_component_builder` opens an **unauthenticated** local callback
server (`127.0.0.1:9221+`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, no token/origin
check) for up to 10 minutes per call; any local process or open browser tab
can `POST` to it and that body is injected **verbatim** into the tool result
the model consumes (job8 audit, `dist/utils/callback-server.js:36`). This is
in the third-party package's code, not this repo's config — **we don't patch
it**. The mitigation lives entirely on our side: `settings.json`
`permissions.ask` explicitly lists all 4 `mcp__magic__*` tools ([[BDR-059]]),
so every call — builder included — requires a live confirmation and can
never auto-execute. Don't allowlist
`21st_magic_component_builder` or `21st_magic_component_refiner` (arbitrary
absolute-path read → vendor exfil, same audit) under any circumstance.

## Diagnostic and maintenance

```bash
# Terminal
bash doctor.sh              # full diagnostic (symlinks, plugins, permissions, token budget)
bash update-all.sh          # update all components (CLI, plugins, submodules, symlinks)

# Claude Code
/health                     # gstack code-quality dashboard (doctor.sh -> make doctor)
/status                     # project snapshot (plugins, git, GSD milestone)
/plugin-check "description" # audit plugin config vs project needs

# Makefile (from repo directory)
make install                # bootstrap: CLI + auth + symlinks + plugins
make plugin                 # install plugins only
make link                   # create/update symlinks into ~/.claude/
make doctor                 # diagnostic
make update                 # update Claude Code, config, submodules, plugins, and verify
make test                   # run deterministic tests (lib/tests/*.test.sh + lib/seo-data/*.test.sh + lib/gitflow-test.sh)
make onboard                # onboard an existing project (run from its dir)
make seo-connect            # connect a Google account for /seo FULL (OAuth consent)
make profile cmd="set X"    # activate a skill profile (design/dev/qa/audit/minimal/full)
make profile-list           # list skill profiles
make profile-current        # show the active profile
make profile-reset          # re-enable all gstack skills
make new-skill name=myskill # scaffold agent + skill files
```

`doctor.sh` checks: symlinks, GStack submodule, prerequisites (git, Node, Cargo, Python, Claude Code), plugins, permissions, token budget, config consistency.
